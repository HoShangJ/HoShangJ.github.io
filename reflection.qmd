## Reflection on the use of GenAI

- I used ChatGPT to support this assessment by generating code examples, fixing errors, and refining explanations. 
- It saved time and clarified concepts quickly. However, outputs require verification and critical thinking. 
- In future studies and work, GenAI will assist brainstorming, coding, and documentation while I remain responsible for ethical academic use.
