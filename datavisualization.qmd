## About the Project
This project aims to build a rule-driven system for detecting phishing emails. It leverages Python to analyze and evaluate email content using text analysis and logic-based strategies. The project should include a simple user interface for users to analyze their emails. The system will apply various techniques to classify emails as either ham or spam, helping to reinforce programming fundamentals, including string manipulation and problem decomposition.

## Problems to be addressed
Phishing remains one of the most widespread cyber threats in Singapore and worldwide. Such emails exploit emotions like fear, urgency, curiosity, and kindness to appear more convincing. Attackers often impersonate celebrities or trusted companies to trick victims into revealing personal information. Many fall for these scams due to the urgency to respond, perceived authority, or a desire to help. According to a Yahoo News report from August 2025 [1], nearly half a billion dollars were lost across about 20,000 scam cases in Singapore during the first half of 2025.

## The scoring system consists of three parts
```{r}
#| echo: false
labels <- c("Domain Verification", "URL analysis", "Keyword Detection")
values <- c(5, 6, 15)
percentages <- round(values / sum(values) * 100, 1)
label_text <- paste0(labels, "\n", percentages, "%")
colors <- c("#4285F4", "#EA4335", "#FBBC05")
pie(
  values,
  labels = label_text,
  col = colors,
  border = "white",
  main = "Maximum Score Distribution (max 26)",
  cex.main = 1.4,
  cex = 1
)
```
**Based on our testing, component caps prevent single-factor dominance. Without caps, keyword-rich but legitimate emails would be misclassified.**
