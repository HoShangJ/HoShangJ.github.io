It leverages Python to analyze and evaluate email content using text analysis and logic-based strategies. The project should include a simple user interface for users to analyze their emails. The system will apply various techniques to classify emails as either ham or spam, helping to reinforce programming fundamentals, including string manipulation and problem decomposition."

Such emails exploit emotions like fear, urgency, curiosity, and kindness to appear more convincing. Attackers often impersonate celebrities or trusted companies to trick victims into revealing personal information. Many fall for these scams due to the urgency to respond, perceived authority, or a desire to help. According to a Yahoo News report from August 2025 [1], nearly half a billion dollars were lost across about 20,000 scam cases in Singapore during the first half of 2025."
